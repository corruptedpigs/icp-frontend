            <p className="mb-2">In &quot;Animal Farm&quot; by George Orwell, the allegorical tale portrays a group of farm animals who overthrow their human farmer in pursuit of a society where all animals are equal.</p>

            <p>However, their utopian vision is corrupted over time as power dynamics shift and a new ruling class of pigs emerges, led by Napoleon and Snowball. The pigs exploit their fellow animals for personal gain, betraying the principles of equality and fairness upon which the revolution was founded.</p>
